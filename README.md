DuneGPT is a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model implemented from scratch using Python and PyTorch. It follows the "Attention is All You Need" paper, OpenAI's GPT-2/GPT-3 architectures, and incorporating insights from Andrej Karpathy. This project demonstrates a deep learning model trained on the entire Dune catalog. The model is designed for high-accuracy text generation tasks, leveraging advanced techniques such as self-attention mechanisms, multi-headed attention, and positional encoding.
