DuneGPT is a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model implemented from scratch using Python and PyTorch. Following the "Attention is All You Need" paper and inspired by OpenAI's GPT-2/GPT-3 architectures, this project demonstrates a deep learning model trained on the entire Dune catalog. The model is designed for high-accuracy text generation tasks, leveraging advanced techniques such as self-attention mechanisms, multi-headed attention, and positional encoding.

This project aims to showcase the capabilities of GPT models in natural language processing (NLP) and provide a comprehensive implementation for educational and research purposes.
